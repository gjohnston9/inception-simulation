### Setting up

- For the simulation, you will need Python 2 and Python's NumPy library.
- For the visualization software, you will need Java?

### Running the code

- To run our experiments and generate log files, navigate to the `Simulation` directory and run `python run_simulation.py`
- To visualize the results, navigate to the `Visualization` directory and run `./build.sh && java -jar Visualizer.jar`
- If you can't visualize the results, you can look at the bottom of the generated log files (in the `Logs` directory) to see the value of output variables for each experiment.
